# TicTacToe Minimax AI

Compile with:
	
	make tictactoe

## Project Goals
I had a number of goals in mind when writing this project:

1. Impliment the miniMax algorithm successfully.
2. Create the cleanest and most functional UX I could within
a terminal window.
3. Write code which as easy as possible to read and understand
by using self documentation principles, 
good control flow, and appropriate comments.

## Additional Notes
The main code for the tic tac toe game I downloaded from:
http://www.cppforschool.com/project/tic-tac-toe-project.html
I have edited parts of the code so that it can properly interface
with my min/max algorithm and to improve UI.

## Future improvements
* Recreate the code in python or Java to more easily integrate it onto
a website with a more sophisticated UI.
* Allow user to decide which symbol they would like to be.
* Add an element of randomness to the AI's behavior, allow for different
levels of difficulty.
* Implimentation on a 4x4 or 5x5 board.
